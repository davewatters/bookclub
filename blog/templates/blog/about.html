            <p>
              We love to read and we don't do coffee mornings 
              in the parish hall.  This is about the enjoyment 
              of reading and making new friends in a relaxed social setting.
              No one in this group should feel obliged to read EVERY book EVERY month. 
              We all lead busy lives. We are an easy going bunch. 
              Come and make some new friends, share a laugh, have 
              a few drinks, have something to eat, talk about all types 
              of topics & generally just have a good time.
            </p>
            <p>Stuff you might like to know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We meet on the third Tuesday of each month at the "Great Dublin Pub"</li>
              <li>Member ages range from 18 upwards. Everyoneâ€™s welcome!</li>
              <li>We have members of all ages from all walks of life.</li>
              <li>Books are recommended by members via e-mail or at the meetup.</li>
              <li>The recommendation shortlist consists of 10 to 15 books. When new books are
                recommended, the oldest ones are removed from the list.</li>
              <li>You can vote for the book you want to read at the meetup, 
                or alternatively via email. The day after the meetup, all votes 
                are counted & the book with the most amount of votes will 
                be posted on the website.</li>
              <li>Votes accumulate: if you voted for a certain book but it didn't get 
                enough votes to be one of this month's favourites, the votes still stand. 
                When new votes for that book come in next month, it might be one of the 
                two with the most total votes, hence one we're going to read!</li>
              <li>Details & a map for the venue can be found via the link supplied 
                under the WHERE heading on the webpage</li>
